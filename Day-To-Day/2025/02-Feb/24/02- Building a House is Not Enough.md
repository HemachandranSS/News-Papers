## **Building a House is Not Enough… You Must Do This One Thing!**

Owning a house is more than just having a place to stay; it represents social status and personal achievement. A home is one of the biggest financial investments in a person's life, often requiring years of savings or loans. However, ensuring that the house remains a source of joy and security rather than stress is crucial.  

One of the biggest risks to a home is damage from natural disasters or accidents. This is why **home insurance** is essential. Buying or constructing a house should always be followed by securing **home insurance** to protect it from unforeseen events like floods, earthquakes, fire, and theft.  

### **Key Points to Consider When Choosing Home Insurance**  

### **1. What is Covered?**  
Before choosing a home insurance policy, it is essential to understand what is covered. Coverage usually includes:  
- **Structural protection**: Damage to the house due to fire, floods, or other disasters.  
- **Content protection**: Coverage for appliances, furniture, and valuable possessions inside the house.  
- **Theft or burglary protection**: Coverage for stolen or damaged items.  

Different insurance companies offer various types of coverage, so it is essential to choose one that fits your needs.  

### **2. Customize Your Plan**  
Not every insurance feature may be necessary for your home. Customizing the plan based on your specific needs and budget can help you avoid unnecessary expenses.  

### **3. Location Matters**  
The location of your house plays a major role in insurance costs.  
- If your home is in an area prone to **floods or earthquakes**, you may need additional coverage.  
- Houses in high-risk areas generally require **higher premiums**.  

Knowing the risks in your area can help you choose the right insurance.  

### **4. Provide Accurate Information**  
When purchasing home insurance, providing **accurate details** is crucial. Incorrect information can lead to claim rejection. Important details to disclose include:  
- Number of floors in the house.

Many insurance providers offer **add-ons** for extra security, such as:

- **Pet protection.**  
- **Protection against accidental damages.**  

These add-ons require an extra premium but can be beneficial in the long run.  

### **6. Claim Settlement Ratio**  
Before choosing an insurance provider, check their **claim settlement ratio (CSR)**—the percentage of claims successfully settled by the company.  
- A **high CSR (above 90%)** indicates a **reliable company** that is more likely to approve claims.  
- A **low CSR** suggests possible delays or denials in claim processing.  

### **7. Know What is Not Covered**  
Just as it is important to know what is covered, it is equally important to understand **exclusions** in a home insurance policy. Some common exclusions include:  
- **Pre-existing damage.**

Always read the **terms and conditions** before finalizing your insurance to avoid surprises when filing a claim.
