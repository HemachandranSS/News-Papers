### **Explanation of the Article in Simple Terms**  

The Indian rupee (₹) gained significant value against the US dollar on Tuesday, closing at ₹86.83 per dollar. This was the highest single-day rise in almost two years, mainly due to intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  

The RBI took action because the rupee had been weakening due to the strong US dollar. By selling a large amount of dollars in the market, the RBI helped push the rupee’s value up. Along with this, foreign investments in Indian debt markets also contributed to the rupee's rise.  

Experts believe this move will stabilize the currency, but over the long term, the rupee is expected to return to levels between ₹80-85 per dollar. However, global economic conditions, including US interest rates and trade policies, could still impact its movement.  

There is also an important meeting scheduled between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former US President Donald Trump, which could impact trade tariffs and, in turn, the rupee’s future value.
