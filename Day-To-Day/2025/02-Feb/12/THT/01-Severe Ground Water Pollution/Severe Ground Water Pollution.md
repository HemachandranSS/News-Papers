### **Summary of the Article: "Severe Groundwater Pollution"**

This Tamil article discusses the alarming levels of groundwater pollution in India, highlighting the presence of harmful chemicals, their impact on health, and possible solutions. Below is a simplified explanation:

### **Salient Points**  
1. **Groundwater Contamination Crisis**  
   - Groundwater in India is highly polluted due to industrial and agricultural activities.
   - The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) conducted a study revealing widespread contamination.  
   - Many sources of drinking water contain toxic chemicals exceeding safe limits.  

2. **Major Pollutants Found in Groundwater**  
   - **Heavy metals** like lead, arsenic, and cadmium.
   - **Pesticides and fertilizers** from agricultural runoff.
   - **Industrial waste** contributing to dangerous chemical levels.  

3. **Health Risks**  
   - **Fluoride contamination** leads to dental and skeletal fluorosis.  
   - **Arsenic poisoning** can cause cancer and skin diseases.  
   - **Lead exposure** affects brain development, particularly in children.  
   - **Nitrate pollution** leads to "blue baby syndrome" in infants.  

4. **Extent of the Problem**  
   - Water in **17 states** of India has high levels of arsenic.  
   - In many locations, **fluoride levels exceed safe limits**.  
   - **About 70% of India's water sources are contaminated**, affecting millions.  

5. **Scientific Analysis**  
   - Pollution levels in groundwater were found **as high as 532 parts per billion (ppb)**, far above safe limits.  
   - Reverse osmosis (RO) is suggested as a purification method, but it’s expensive for rural areas.  

6. **Government and Research Efforts**  
   - Studies by organizations like **BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre)** focus on reducing contamination.  
   - There are efforts to introduce **organic farming** to reduce chemical runoff.  
   - India aims to implement better water management strategies by **2030**.

### **Facts & Figures**  
- **180 districts** in India have serious groundwater pollution issues.  
- **70% of India's drinking water sources** are contaminated.  
- **17 states** report **high arsenic levels** in water.  
- **Fluoride levels** exceed safety limits in many regions.  
- **532 parts per billion (ppb)** of pollutants found in some groundwater samples.

### **Conclusion**  
The article warns that groundwater pollution in India is a severe issue, affecting public health on a large scale. Immediate government intervention, better waste management, and the promotion of organic farming are necessary to ensure clean drinking water for future generations.
