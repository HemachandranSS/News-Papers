### **Explanation of the Article in Simple Terms**  

Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) **V. Anantha Nageswaran** is pointing out a misunderstanding among government departments: **putting processes online (digitisation) is not the same as reducing unnecessary rules and regulations (deregulation)**. Just making something digital does not mean businesses have fewer compliance burdens—it just moves paperwork from offline to online.  

He highlights that India needs to **reduce unnecessary regulations, especially for small businesses**, so they can grow without spending too much time on compliance. He also discusses **global economic trends**, saying that:  
- **Globalisation is slowing down**, and India will have to depend more on its domestic economy for growth.  
- **Inflation is likely to remain high globally**, making goods and services more expensive.  
- **If India can control inflation between 3-4% (instead of the current 4-5%)**, it will help reduce the fall in the rupee's value against the dollar.  
- The rupee has historically **depreciated at about 3% per year**, matching the inflation difference between India and the U.S.  

Regarding **energy policy**, he says India should focus on **energy security** while transitioning to green energy. He warns against blindly following extreme green energy policies like some European countries. He also says **nuclear energy should play a bigger role** in India's energy future.
