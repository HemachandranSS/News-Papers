### **Salient Points & Detailed Suggestions:**  

#### 1. **Avoid Over-Supervision by Parents**
   - Trust your child’s ability to manage their studies. Constant monitoring can be counterproductive.  
   - Encourage self-discipline by expressing trust: *“I believe in you. Study at your own pace.”*

#### 2. **The Power of Sample Papers**
   - Practice past five years' board exam question papers.  
   - This helps students familiarize themselves with question patterns and potential rephrasings.

#### 3. **Create a Study Timetable**
   - Allocate more time for challenging subjects while ensuring all subjects are reviewed.  
   - Consistency is key; daily study sessions prevent last-minute panic.

#### 4. **Use Mnemonics for Key Points**
   - Encourage students to create memory aids by forming simple words from the first letters of key terms.  
   - This helps in retaining complex information easily.

#### 5. **Importance of Adequate Sleep**
   - At least six hours of quality sleep is essential to maintain focus and cognitive function.  
   - Sleep deprivation can negatively affect memory retention and exam performance.

   - Keep study rooms free from gadgets like smartphones and computers unless needed for study purposes.  
   - Distraction-free environments improve concentration and productivity.

   - Offer help only when requested, such as listening to recitations.
