### **Key Salient Points:**  

1. **Market Volatility:**  
   - The stock market has faced significant turbulence due to global factors such as tariff issues from the US, a stronger dollar, persistent inflation, and geopolitical tensions.  
   - Benchmark indices in India have declined by over 10%, and mid-cap/small-cap stocks have suffered losses of up to 50% from their peaks.

2. **Impact on Investors:**  
   - Many new investors have faced losses in their Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs).  
   - Momentum-based investing strategies have taken a severe hit, with the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index down by over 20%.

3. **Performance of Select Funds:**  
   - Funds like **Parag Parikh Flexicap Fund** limited their decline to 2.9% compared to an 11.6% drop in the Nifty 500 TRI.  
   - These funds have consistently outperformed both the markets and their categories over the past year.

4. **Investment Strategy:**  
   - Disciplined, long-term approaches and a focus on large-cap stocks protected funds during the downturn.  
   - Examples include:  
     - **SBI Focused Equity Fund**: 75% allocation to large-cap stocks.  
     - **HDFC Focused 30 Fund**: 80% large-cap allocation.  
     - **Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund**: Maintained a focused portfolio of high-quality mid-cap stocks.  

5. **Active vs. Passive Funds:**  
   - Passive funds mirror an index without flexibility, even if certain stocks are overvalued or have poor prospects.  
   - Active funds, on the other hand, can selectively invest, offering the flexibility to outperform benchmarks.  
   - Funds like Parag Parikh Flexicap even invest in foreign equities, providing diversification benefits.
