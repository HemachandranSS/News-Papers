### **Salient Points**  

#### **1. The Growing Threat of Forest Fires**  
- Wildfires recently devastated **Los Angeles**, causing destruction and displacement.  
- In **India, over 36% of forests** are prone to fires.  
- **Forest fire incidents have increased 10 times in 20 years**, while forest cover has increased by only **1.12%**.  

#### **2. Causes of Forest Fires**  
- **90% of fires are human-caused** – due to land clearing, slash-and-burn farming, and careless behavior.  
- Climate change, **rising temperatures**, and **long dry spells** make forests more vulnerable.  

#### **3. Impact of Forest Fires**  
- **Environmental:** Loss of trees, wildlife, biodiversity, and increased carbon emissions.  
  - **India emits ~69 million tonnes of CO2 annually** from forest fires.  
- **Economic:** Loss of timber and non-timber products, affecting communities.  
  - **Annual economic loss due to forest degradation (including fires): ₹1.74 lakh crore**.  
- **Social:** Displacement of wildlife, human-wildlife conflicts, water cycle disruption, and soil degradation.  

#### **4. Existing Government Efforts**  
- **National Action Plan on Forest Fires** and **Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme (FFPMS)** assist states in fire control.  

#### **5. Challenges in Fire Management**  
- **Funding issues:** The FFPMS budget fluctuates, ranging from ₹28 crore to ₹51 crore in recent years.  
- **Technology gaps:** Current fire alert systems **cannot differentiate between forest fires and other fires**, causing delays in response.  

#### **6. Solutions and Recommendations**  
- **Technology Upgrades:**  
  - **Advanced predictive modelling** to identify fire-prone areas.  
  - **Drones with thermal imaging** to monitor and guide firefighting.  
  - **Data integration** from various agencies like the Forest Survey of India and ISRO.  
- **Community Involvement:**  
  - Using **mobile apps, SMS alerts, and helplines** for fire reporting.  
  - Encouraging self-help groups (like women collecting pine needles in Uttarakhand).  
  - Learning from **Nepal’s Community Forest User Groups** and **Indonesia’s Fire-Free Village Program**.  
  - Engaging youth as **‘forest fire scouts’**.  
- **Policy & Infrastructure:**  
  - **Consistent budget allocation** for fire management.  
  - Training and equipping local responders.

### **Key Takeaway**  
Forest fires are a major **environmental, economic, and social issue**. Addressing them requires **policy improvements, better funding, advanced technology, and active community participation**. While India has made efforts, more needs to be done to prevent and manage these disasters effectively.
