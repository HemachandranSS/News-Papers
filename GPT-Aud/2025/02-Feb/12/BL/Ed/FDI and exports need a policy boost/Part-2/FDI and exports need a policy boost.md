     - **Uncertain global economic conditions** (including high inflation and rising interest rates).  

2. **Long-Term Strategy: High-Value Sector Focus**  
   - The Survey suggests **India should become a strategic partner in advanced, high-value industries**.  
   - These industries include:  
     - **Biotechnology** (medical research, pharmaceuticals, genetic engineering).  
     - **Semiconductors** (critical for electronics and digital economy).  
     - **Space technologies** (satellite development, aerospace advancements).  
   - This shift would help India **establish a strong position in the global economy** and attract high-quality investments.  

3. **Short-Term Strategy: Diversifying the Export Basket**  
   - To **reduce dependence on a few industries**, India should:

### **Conclusion:**

## **5. Conclusion**

### **Final Thought:**  
The Budget **takes some necessary steps**, but **India still has a long way to go in making its FDI and export policies globally competitive**.
